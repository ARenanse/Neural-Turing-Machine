An attempt at Understanding and Implementation of the corresponding Paper by Alex Graves et al.

Progress Timeline:

1. Wed, Jan 15:-
+ Completed the NTMCell Implementation along with various Vector Generation Tasks.
+ __Also tested it's result with dynamic_RNN, observed some NaN values in the result, was fixed by Initializing      States by a considerably high (2.53 in this case) value.__
