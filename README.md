Wed, Jan 15:   __Completed the NTMCell Implementation along with various Vector Generation Tasks.__<br />
               __Also tested it's result with dynamic_RNN, observed some NaN values in the result, was fixed by Initializing States by 
                a considerably high (2.53 in this case) value.__
